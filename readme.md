This repository contains 1 single simple binary executable which takes input from a text file in the same directory named 'test.txt'. 
the main.rs processes the test data , convert the endpoints as needed and validate the results using test file itself.

Steps to compile the program: 
download the repository to your system, 
open it using vscode, 
and on command line execute 'cargo run'. 
Since there is only one executable binary, no additional commands needed!
